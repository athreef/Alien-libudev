=head1 NAME

Alien::libudev - Perl distribution for libudev

=for html <a href="https://travis-ci.org/athreef/Alien-libudev"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/athreef/Alien-libudev.svg?branch=master"></a>

=head1 INSTALL

    cpan Alien::libudev

=head1 eudev

Apparently, you can't build libudev separately from systemd anymore.
Some Gentoo developers have forked udev as eudev, with the aim of keeping
it isolated from systemd. This is what this module builds.

If you prefer systemd's libudev, install it over your distro's package
manager. e.g. on Debian:

    sudo apt-get install libudev-dev

Installing this module on a system with systemd's libudev is effectively
a no-op.
